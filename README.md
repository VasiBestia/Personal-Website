# 💻 Alexandru Gabriel's Personal Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website – a digital reflection of my passion for programming, web design, and clean user experience.

## 🚀 Purpose of This Website

This website isn't just a portfolio. It's **my personal tech space**, a place where I:

- Present who I am and what I do.
- Showcase my skills in modern front-end development.
- Share my story, projects, and future goals.
- Invite collaboration, feedback, and opportunities.

Whether you're here as a recruiter, a fellow developer, or just curious – you're in the right place.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

This project is built with a modern and aesthetic tech stack:

- **HTML5 & CSS3** – core structure and styling.
- **Bootstrap** – responsive design with a powerful grid system.

- **Responsive layout** – works beautifully on all screen sizes.

## ✨ Highlights
